# Key Promoter X Plugin

The Key Promoter Plugin is intended to show hints when using the mouse for
something that can be done with a keyboard shortcut.
To replace tedious mouse work is crucial if you intend to get used to
IntelliJ IDEA and become an efficient developer.

**Honor to whom honor is due:** This plugin was originally [implemented by
Dmitry Kashin](https://code.google.com/p/key-promoter/)
who unfortunately stopped maintaining the code and pushed the
last version in 2012, more than 5 years ago.

[User athiele](https://github.com/athiele/key-promoter-fork/commits/master)
took the time to fork the original code, fix issues and provide
a version that can be used on recent IDEA versions, but wasn't active
since 2016.

Although I'm not sure how much time I can spend on this, I'm confident that
I will be active and respond to issue (or even better pull-requests) in the
foreseeable future. Let us try to actively maintain this fine plugin so
that as much users as possible can benefit from it.

## Additional Features / Modifications

* Statistics are persisted and thereby not deleted when closing the IDE.
* A top ten missed shortcuts window is added to the IDE. Thereby, it is more obvious which shortcut combinations are worth learning for you to increase your personal efficiency.
* A button that resets your statistics. 
* Support for up-to-date IntelliJ versions.
