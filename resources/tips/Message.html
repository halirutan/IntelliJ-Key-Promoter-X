<h2>Key Promoter X for 2020.1 EAP Products</h2>
<p>
    At this point, I'd like to give a big thanks to
    <a href="https://github.com/dbabiak">Daniel Babiak</a>,
    <a href="https://github.com/sthagen">Stefan Hagen</a>, and
    <a href="https://github.com/JoshuaLuckers">Joshua L&uuml;ckers</a> for sponsoring the Key Promoter X with $4 per
    month.
    Additionally, I highly appreciate the support from 5 people who give $2/month and 15 others who committed to
    $1/month.
    You are awesome!
</p>
<p>
    If you also appreciate my efforts, then please <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/halirutan">consider sponsoring
    me on
    GitHub</a>.
    And don't forget to <a href="https://github.com/halirutan/IntelliJ-Key-Promoter-X">star the GitHub repository</a>
    and
    leave a rating on the <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9792-key-promoter-x">JetBrains plugin site</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, don't be too shy to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/halirutan/">connect on LinkedIn</a>. I'd like to
    know in which parts of the world the Key Promoter X is used.
