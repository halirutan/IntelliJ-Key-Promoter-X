The Key Promoter X helps you to learn essential shortcuts while you are working.
When you use the mouse on a button inside the IDE, the Key Promoter X shows you the keyboard shortcut that you
should have used instead. This provides an easy way to learn how
to replace tedious mouse work with keyboard keys and helps to transition to a faster, mouse free development.
The Key Promoter X tool window shows you a hit-list of the mouse actions you use the most and directly provides you
with the shortcut you can use instead. For buttons that don't have a shortcut, the Key Promoter X prompts you with
the possibility to directly create one.
