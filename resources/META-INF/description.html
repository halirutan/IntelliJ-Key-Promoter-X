The Key Promoter X helps you to learn essential shortcuts while you are working.
When you use the mouse on a button inside the IDE, the Key Promoter X shows you the keyboard shortcut that you
should have used instead.<br/>
This provides an easy way to learn how
to replace tedious mouse work with keyboard keys and helps to transition to a faster, mouse free development.
The Key Promoter X tool window shows you a hit-list of the mouse actions you use the most and directly provides you
with the shortcut you can use instead. For buttons that don't have a shortcut, the Key Promoter X prompts you with
the possibility to directly create one.

Sponsors allow me to dedicate time to the plugin and keep it running on all the JetBrains IDEs you love.
