<strong>A plugin to learn the IntelliJ IDEA shortcuts.</strong>
<br/>
The Key Promoter X helps you to learn essential shortcuts while you are working.
When you use the mouse on a button inside the IDE, the Key Promoter X shows you the keyboard shortcut that you should
have used instead. This provides an easy way to learn how
to replace tedious mouse work with keyboard keys and helps to transition to a faster, mouse free development.
Currently, it supports toolbar buttons, menu buttons, tool windows and the actions therein.
<br/>
<br/>
The Key Promoter X tool window shows you a hit-list of the mouse actions you use the most and directly provides you
with the shortcut you can use instead. For buttons that don't have a shortcut, the Key Promoter X prompts you with
the possibility to directly create one.

Dmitry Kashin had the original idea for a "Key Promoters" but used custom UI elements which often clashed with the
IntelliJ IDEA UI. Key Promoter X is a completely rewritten version of the original idea and removes the custom pop-up
window with IntelliJ internal message balloons.
It, therefore, integrates much better into the IDE, fixes glitches and provides a more non-disruptive
way of learning shortcut bindings.
